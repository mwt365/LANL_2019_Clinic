         divide the time dimension to look for a consistent peak
      -  min_height: the minimum fraction of the strongest squashed peak
         to consider when looking for baselines
      -  min_separation: the minimum separation of baselines, in m/s
      -  peak_width: to be considered a peak, look at points at this remove
         (in m/s) from a candidate peak to see that their values are lower than
         max_side_lobe times the peak's value
      -  min_percent: minimum percentage of segments satisfying the peak criterion
         described above under peak_width

         less than or equal to max_side_lobe times the peak's value

        isolated time. It might be better to chop the range into several
